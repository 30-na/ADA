# Kangaroos skull measurements: mandible length

_What effect does sex and species have on the mandible length of a kangaroo skull?_

The data to be analyzed here are selected skull measurements on 148 kangaroos
of known sex and species.
There are 11 columns of data, corresponding to the following features.
The measurements are in meters/10000 (mm/10).

column | Variable name | Description
-|-|-
1  *| sex           | sex (1=M, 2=F)
2  *| species       | species (0=M. giganteus, 1=M.f. melanops, 2=M.f. fuliginosus)
3   | pow           | post orbit width
4   | rw            | rostal width
5   | sopd          | supra-occipital - paroccipital depth
6   | cw            | crest width
7   | ifl           | incisive foramina length
8  *| ml            | mandible length
9   | mw            | mandible width
10  | md            | mandible depth
11  | arh           | ascending ramus height

Some of the observations in the data set are missing (not available). These are
represented by a period `.`, which in the `read_csv()` function is specified
by the `na = "."` option.

```{R}
library(erikmisc)
library(tidyverse)

# First, download the data to your computer,
#   save in the same folder as this Rmd file.

dat_kang <-
  read_csv(
    "ADA2_CL_09_kang.csv"
  , na = c("", ".")
  ) %>%
  # subset only our columns of interest
  select(
    sex, species, ml
  ) %>%
  # make dose a factor variable and label the levels
  mutate(
    sex     = factor(sex    , labels = c("M","F"))
  , species = factor(species, labels = c("Mg", "Mfm", "Mff"))
  )

# remove observations with missing values
n_start  <- nrow(dat_kang)
dat_kang <- na.omit(dat_kang)
n_keep   <- nrow(dat_kang)
n_drop   <- n_start - n_keep
cat("Removed", n_start, "-", n_keep, "=", n_drop, "observations with missing values.")

# The first few observations
head(dat_kang)
```

## __(1 p)__ Interpret plots of the data, distributional centers and shapes

The side-by-side boxplots of the data compare the
mandible lengths across the 6 combinations of sex and species.
Comment on the distributional shapes and compare the typical
mandible lengths across groups.



```{R, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8}
# Calculate the cell means for each (sex, species) combination
# Group means
kang_mean     <- dat_kang %>%                            dplyr::summarise(m = mean(ml))
kang_mean_x   <- dat_kang %>% group_by(sex)          %>% dplyr::summarise(m = mean(ml)) %>% ungroup()
kang_mean_s   <- dat_kang %>% group_by(species)      %>% dplyr::summarise(m = mean(ml)) %>% ungroup()
kang_mean_xs  <- dat_kang %>% group_by(sex, species) %>% dplyr::summarise(m = mean(ml)) %>% ungroup()

# Interaction plots, ggplot
library(ggplot2)
p1 <- ggplot(dat_kang, aes(x = sex, y = ml, colour = species))
#p1 <- p1 + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), colour = "black"
#                  , linetype = "solid", size = 0.2, alpha = 0.3)
p1 <- p1 + geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5, outlier.size=0.1)
p1 <- p1 + geom_point(data = kang_mean_xs, aes(y = m), size = 4)
p1 <- p1 + geom_line(data = kang_mean_xs, aes(y = m, group = species), size = 1.5)
p1 <- p1 + labs(title = "Kangaroo interaction plot, species by sex")
#print(p1)

p2 <- ggplot(dat_kang, aes(x = species, y = ml, colour = sex))
#p2 <- p2 + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), colour = "black"
#                  , linetype = "solid", size = 0.2, alpha = 0.3)
p2 <- p2 + geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5, outlier.size=0.1)
p2 <- p2 + geom_point(data = kang_mean_xs, aes(y = m), size = 4)
p2 <- p2 + geom_line(data = kang_mean_xs, aes(y = m, group = sex), size = 1.5)
p2 <- p2 + labs(title = "Kangaroo interaction plot, sex by species")
#print(p2)

library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(grobs = list(p1, p2), nrow=1, top="Kangaroo crestwidth plots")
```



### Solution
he First plot: The distribution between groups in terms of spread is not very different and we have roughly a symmetric distribution for all groups and roughly same variance. 
There is a big difference in ml size between male and female in MFF group, but there is not a big different between between two sex in MG and MFM group. It seems there is an interaction between sex and in mff species group.



## __(1 p)__ Do the plots above suggest there is an interaction?

Do the lines for each group seem to be very different from parallel?

### Solution

[answer]

yes it seems there is an interaction between sex and in mff species group.






## Fit the two-way interaction model

### Solution

[answer]
```{R}
lm_ml_x_s_xs <-
  lm(
    ml ~ sex + species + sex:species
  , data = dat_kang
  , contrasts = list(sex = contr.sum, species = contr.sum)
  )
```






## __(1 p)__ Check model assumptions for full model

Recall that we assume that the full model is correct before we perform model reduction by backward selection.

### Solution

[answer]
```{R, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 10}
# plot diagnostics
e_plot_lm_diagostics(lm_ml_x_s_xs)
```

The residuals are roughly distributed normal based on QQplot. there are no significant outlier. the distribution of data in male group is wider in compare to female but the this difference is not big. There is not enough evidence that we can tell variance is not constant between all groups. based on box-cox plot we do not need transformation. in residuals vs index we can see an structure, because the data have been sorted by sex and species so this is not interpretable. 
the assumptions are met.

## __(3 p)__ ANOVA table, test for interaction and main effects

Test for the presence of interaction between sex and species.
Also test for the presence of main effects, effects due to the
sex and species.

### Solution

[answer]

```{R}
library(car)
Anova(lm_ml_x_s_xs, type=3)
```

The interaction between sex and species is significant based on 95% confidence Interval. 




## __(1 p)__ Reduce to final model, test assumptions

If the model can be simplified (because interaction is not significant),
  then refit the model with only the main effects.
Test whether the main effects are significant, reduce further if sensible.
Test model assumptions of your final model.

### Solution

[answer]
The full model is final model because the interaction is significant and the assumptions are met.


## __(2 p)__ Summarize the differences

Summarize differences, if any, in sexes and species using relevant multiple
comparisons. Give clear interpretations of any significant effects.


_This code is here to get you started.
Determine which comparisons you plan to make and modify the appropriate code.
Make the code chunk active by moving the `{R}` to the end of the initial code chunk line._

```
{R}
library(emmeans)
# Contrasts to perform pairwise comparisons
cont_kang <- emmeans(lm_object, specs = "sex")
cont_kang <- emmeans(lm_object, specs = "species")
cont_kang <- emmeans(lm_object, specs = "sex", by = c("species"))
cont_kang <- emmeans(lm_object, specs = "species", by = c("sex"))
# Means and CIs
confint(cont_kang, adjust = "bonferroni")
# Pairwise comparisons
cont_kang %>% pairs(adjust = "bonf")   # adjust = "tukey" is default
```

__EMM plot interpretation__

This __EMM plot (Estimated Marginal Means, aka Least-Squares Means)__
  is only available when conditioning on one variable.
The __blue bars__ are confidence intervals for the EMMs;
  don't ever use confidence intervals for
  EMMs to perform comparisons -- they can be very misleading.
The __red arrows__ are for the comparisons among means;
  the degree to which the "comparison arrows" overlap reflects as much as
  possible the significance of the comparison of the two estimates.
If an arrow from one mean overlaps an arrow from
  another group, the difference is not significant, based on the adjust setting
  (which defaults to "tukey").

```
{R, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6}
# Plot means and contrasts
p <- plot(cont_kang, comparisons = TRUE, adjust = "bonf")
p <- p + labs(title = "Bonferroni-adjusted contrasts")
p <- p + theme_bw()
print(p)
```

Please refer to the Chapter 5 section named __`emmeans` and Bonferroni corrections__
  for how to appropriately calculate the Bonferroni p-values
  for a two-way interaction model.

cont_kang <- emmeans(lm_ml_x_s_xs, specs = "sex", by = c("species"))
# Means and CIs

# Plot means and contrasts
p <- plot(cont_kang, comparisons = TRUE)
p <- p + labs(title = "Tukey-adjusted contrasts")
p <- p + theme_bw()
print(p)

```
### Solution

[answer]

There are significant size differences (183.4 units in average) between male and female in mff species. also in male group there is significant difference (107.8 units in average) between mfm and mff species, but there is no significant in females.  




## __(1 p)__ Summarize the results in a few sentences

### Solution

[answer]
we analized the data to see What effect does sex and species have on the mandible length of a kangaroo skull. we fit a two way anova model and base on the model the interaction was significant. all the model assumptions were met. There are significant size differences between male and female in mff species. also in male group there is significant difference between mfm and mff species.
